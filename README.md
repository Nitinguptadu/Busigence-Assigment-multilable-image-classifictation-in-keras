# Busigence-Assigment-multilable-image-classifictation-in-keras

Classify the images	 according to their given label using  keras  . build	the  model from the	 scratch.  As  this  is a multi-­‐label classification problem 


Done some transformation on Given lables to train the model

Problem in data set 

1) train data dir consits of apporx 14 thousand images but its lable file consits of 15 thousand lables you have to delete those rows ( to solve this problem [Mapping and removing rows from csv file.ipynb is used on train lables] )


2) Did not provided required cvs to map lables with there original names for that problem we have to some preprocessing on it 
 ( to solve this problem [one hot encodong.ipynb] )
